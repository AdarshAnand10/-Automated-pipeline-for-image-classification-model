# Adversarial Attack Implementation and Analysis

This repository contains an implementation of adversarial attacks on deep learning models, specifically targeting image classification tasks. The project demonstrates the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial examples and explores various attack methods and defense strategies.

## Features

- Implementation of multiple adversarial attack methods (FGSM, PGD)
- Robust evaluation framework for model performance
- Visualization tools for analyzing attack effects
- Defense mechanisms including adversarial training
- Comprehensive performance analysis and reporting

## Requirements

```
torch>=1.8.0
torchvision>=0.9.0
foolbox>=3.3.1
numpy>=1.19.2
matplotlib>=3.3.4
seaborn>=0.11.1
tqdm>=4.59.0
scikit-learn>=0.24.1
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adversarial-attack-implementation.git
cd adversarial-attack-implementation
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will:
- Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Initialize a pre-trained ResNet18 model
- Perform adversarial attacks (FGSM and PGD)
- Generate performance reports and visualizations
- Save results in the `results` directory

## Implementation Details

### Attack Methods

1. **FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method)**
   - Single-step attack using gradient sign
   - Fast but less effective
   - Implementation in `AdvancedAttackFramework._fgsm_attack()`

2. **PGD (Projected Gradient Descent)**
   - Iterative attack with multiple steps
   - More powerful but computationally intensive
   - Implementation in `AdvancedAttackFramework._pgd_attack()`

### Defense Strategies

1. **Adversarial Training**
   - Trains model on both clean and adversarial examples
   - Implementation in `RobustDefenseModule.adversarial_training()`

2. **Gaussian Noise**
   - Adds random noise to input images
   - Implementation in `RobustDefenseModule.gaussian_noise()`

## Results

The program generates:
- Accuracy comparisons between clean and adversarial examples
- Performance metrics for different attack methods
- Detailed analysis of model robustness

Results are saved in the `results` directory with timestamps.
